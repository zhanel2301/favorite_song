I could be the twist, the one to make you stop
The icing on your cake, the cherry on the top
It's heaven in my heart, and we could find you some space, mm
I could be the world to you, the missing piece
That extra sentimental kind of chemistry
Some people make it hard, with me, that isn't the case

'Cause I make it so easy to fall in love
So come give me a call, and we'll fall into us
I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life
Anyone with a heart would agree
It's so easy to fall in love with
